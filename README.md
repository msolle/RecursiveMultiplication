RecursiveMultiplication
=======================
<p>Problem taken from Data Structures & Algorithms In Java 5th Edition</p>
>R-3.1 "Give a recursive algorithm to compute the product of two positive integers *i* and *y* using only addition and subtraction.

Goals and Things Learned:<br/>
-----------------------
  1. Integrate maven and use pom to add JUnit dependencies
  2. Create abbreviated class names for ease of use
  3. Rather then instantiating a new object every test, use <code>@Before</code> annotation to instantiate object before each test method.
  4. Still unsure of proper methodology for JUnit test method naming.
  5. Further increase knowledge of markdown to create more informative README.
